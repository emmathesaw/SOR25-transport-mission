This project showcases a fully autonomous robot designed to navigate a structured environment, identify and retrieve a specific colored part from an inventory zone, deliver it 
to a production line, and return to its starting position. The robot employs a front-mounted Anti-Collision bar with extended side guards, which allows it to securely push 
"parts" without them slipping during transport. The robot begins at its home location, autonomously travels through the enclosed space to the inventory zone, and uses color 
classification to detect and select the correct target part from a collection of options. It then safely transports the part to the production line, avoiding both static and 
dynamic obstacles along the way, including those that share similar color and shape characteristics with the target. After successful delivery, the robot returns home without 
user intervention. Through intelligent navigation, robust part recognition, and collision-free transport, the robot demonstrates reliable execution of a real-world material 
handling task, adapted for use in constrained environments with limited mechanical complexity.
